Celebrating the fourth anniversary of our co-living/hacker space, I crowdsourced and wrote a full 108 card expansion pack matching Cards Against Humanity standards. Packed with inside references, it has a strong presence in our common room game collection (and as a print on the wall) to carry the stories of 20mission forward.
