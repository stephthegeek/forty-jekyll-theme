I co-founded TopNotchThemes, a boutique web design shop specializing in graphic design and theming for the Drupal open source content management system. Three of our themes were included in the Acquia Drupal distribution, and Fusion, our base theming system, became the second most popular free theme for Drupal. We launched the first premium Drupal theme store in 2008.

In my five years running TopNotchThemes, we grew to a distributed team of 6+ and traveled around the world speaking at Drupal conferences.
